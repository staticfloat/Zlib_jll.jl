Kuchling <amk@amk.ca> is\navailable in Python 1.5 and later versions, see\nhttp://docs.python.org/library/zlib.html .\n\nzlib is built into tcl: http://wiki.tcl.tk/4610 .\n\nAn experimental package to read and write files in .zip format, written on top\nof zlib by Gilles Vollant <info@winimage.com>, is available in the\ncontrib/minizip directory of zlib.\n\n\nNotes for some targets:\n\n- For Windows DLL versions, please see win32/DLL_FAQ.txt\n\n- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization. With\n  -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with the -n32\n  compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.\n\n- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1 it works\n  when compiled with cc.\n\n- On Digital Unix 4.0D (formerly OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1 is\n  necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.\n\n- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works with\n  other compilers. Use \"make test\" to check your compiler.\n\n- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS or BEOS.\n\n- For PalmOs, see http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/\n\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\n  The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz.
